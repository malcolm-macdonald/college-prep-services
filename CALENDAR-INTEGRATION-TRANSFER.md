# Calendar Integration Transfer Guide

This document provides detailed instructions for transferring the calendar integration to a customer while maintaining the existing Firebase and Google Cloud infrastructure.

## What Is Being Transferred

This handoff involves:
- **Connecting your Google Calendar** to our existing system so appointments appear on your calendar
- **Setting up your admin email** to receive notifications and send confirmations to clients
- **Testing the integration** to ensure everything works correctly

We are **NOT** transferring:
- The Firebase project or backend infrastructure (we'll continue to host this)
- The service account credentials (these remain unchanged)
- The frontend code (this stays on the current hosting)

## Required Information From You

### 1. Google Calendar Setup

You need to share your Google Calendar with our service account:

- Service Account Email: `calendar-service-account@nick-website-test.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- Instructions:
  1. Open Google Calendar
  2. Find the calendar to be used under "My calendars"
  3. Click the three dots (â‹®) next to the calendar name
  4. Select "Settings and sharing"
  5. Scroll down to "Share with specific people or groups"
  6. Click "Add people" and enter the service account email
  7. Set permissions to "Make changes to events"
  8. Click "Send"
  9. While in settings, copy the Calendar ID from the "Integrate calendar" section (looks like an email address)
  10. **Send us the Calendar ID** so we can update the system

### 2. Admin Email for Notifications

You need to provide us with the email address that will:
1. Receive notifications about new appointments
2. Send confirmation emails to clients

Please provide us with:
- Your preferred email address for notifications
- An app password for this email account (if using Gmail)

We will configure the system with this information.

#### Setting Up Gmail App Password (if using Gmail)

If you're using Gmail, you'll need to create an App Password:
1. Go to your Google Account at https://myaccount.google.com/
2. Select "Security" from the left navigation menu
3. Under "Signing in to Google," select "2-Step Verification" (you must have this enabled)
4. Scroll to the bottom and select "App passwords"
5. Click "Select app" and choose "Other (Custom name)"
6. Enter a name like "College Prep Calendar"
7. Click "Generate"
8. Google will display your 16-character app password - copy this password
9. Share this generated password with us securely (not your regular Gmail password)

### 3. System Deployment

Once you've provided us with:
1. Your Google Calendar ID
2. Your admin email address
3. Your email app password (if using Gmail)

We will:
1. Update the system configuration
2. Deploy the updated functions
3. Test the integration with you

## Post-Transfer Verification

After completing the transfer, we'll verify that everything is working:

1. **Calendar Sharing**: Confirm the service account appears in your calendar sharing settings
2. **Available Slots**: Verify the calendar booking form successfully shows available time slots
3. **Test Booking**: Make a test booking and confirm it appears in your Google Calendar
4. **Email Notifications**: Ensure you receive email notifications when bookings are made
5. **Client Emails**: Verify clients receive confirmation emails from your admin email address

## Troubleshooting Tips

If issues occur:

1. **Check Logs**: We can review Firebase Function logs to identify any problems

2. **Calendar Permissions**: Verify the service account has proper calendar permissions
   - Check Google Calendar sharing settings
   - Ensure the email is correctly entered with no typos

3. **Email Settings**: If emails aren't being sent/received:
   - We may need to verify your email configuration
   - For Gmail, ensure the app password is valid
   - Check spam/junk folders for notification emails

4. **Calendar Availability**: If no available slots are showing:
   - We'll verify the calendar ID is correct
   - Check your calendar for conflicts during business hours
   - Ensure your calendar is not marked as busy during all time slots
